// It's a root class
// The loader is the central class to manage dependencies
// classes based on MulleObjC. MulleObjCFoundation will have a category
// called MulleObjCLoader( Foundation) listing it's classes and categories
// as dependencies.
// Then MulleObjCOSFoundation will have a MulleObjCLoader( OSFoundation) and
// so on. This allows +load code to work in a known environment.
//


/*
   To be dependent on MulleObjC put this before
   your +load code:

   ```
   + (struct _mulle_objc_dependency *) dependencies
   {
      struct _mulle_objc_dependency   dependencies[] =
      {
          { @selector( MulleObjCLoader), MULLE_OBJC_NO_CATEGORYID },
          { MULLE_OBJC_NO_CLASSID, MULLE_OBJC_NO_CATEGORYID }
      };
      return( dependencies);
   }
   ```
